✅ **Tag every resource** with who it's for, when to use it, and what it covers  
✅ **Find the right resource** in seconds instead of minutes  
✅ **Suggest when to use it** with practical staff guidance  
✅ **Keep improving** by learning what's missing

## Understanding Confidence Scores

Every resource has a confidence score (0-100%):

- **90-100%** 🟢 Excellent match - Recommend confidently
- **80-89%** 🟢 Very good match - Recommend
- **70-79%** 🟡 Good match - Quick check first
- **60-69%** 🟡 Fair match - Review carefully
- **Below 60%** 🔴 Poor match - Find alternative

**Example**: If a resource has 95% confidence for "newly diagnosed patient", you can be very confident it's the right resource.
